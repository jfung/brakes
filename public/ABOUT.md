### About this folder:
Anything you put here will be visible to the whole world.
### Pre-defined routes:
There are a couple *special* file names:

   + index.html - this gets served up every time a user tries to visit your homepage.
   + 404.html - if your user navigates to a page that doesn't exist, they'll see this.
   + error.html - only shown when something REALLY BAD (like a server crash) happens.
   + ABOUT.md (this file)  - never ever displayed, this is only for your reference.

### Other stuff:
Your css and javascript goes in this folder too, (I recommend separate js/ and css/ folders).  And you can use folders for your html too.
